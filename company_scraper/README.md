# Purpose
Gets a list of companies.

This is probably the harder problem crate to develop.
## How do we locate some list of companies?

Possible data sources include (kinda want to focus on US companies for now):

- ~~[SEC 4-460 List](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/4-460list.htm)~~
- ~~[Fortune 500](https://fortune.com/fortune500/2021/search/) (Paywall)~~
- ~~LinkedIn Scraping?~~
- ~~[US Chamber of Commerce](https://www.uschamber.com/)~~
- Use the SEC EDGAR database/api to find companies

Captchas might be a concern.
